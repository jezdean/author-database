## Microbit Playground Authors

You are welcome to add your name to this database if you write an article or blog post for microbit playground. 


### The Database

The `author.yml` is a database of each contributor to the microbit playground website. 

Each author looks like this:

```
jez:
  name: Jez Dean
  attribution: Teacher
  description: "I'm a teacher from the UK keen on using technology in my lessons."
  twitter: jezmr
  github: jezdean
  facebook-id:
  website: "https://microbit-playground.co.uk/"
```

In this example, the element is the author name `jez`. It is used in the front matter of the `.md` files which make up the articles and the blog posts.

If adding a new author, replace this with a one word name. The elements are as follows:

`name:`

Your name; real is preferred. 

Used to identify you as an author in rich text markup and on facebook's opengraph.

`attribution:`

Job or similiar title, eg: 'Tech Junkie', 'Geek' etc.

##### Optional

One or two paragraph description about who you are and what you do.

`twitter:`

When the article is shared, it will link to your twitter handle.

`facebook-id:`
